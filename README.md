# TESTING-BITES

**RSpec** is a behaviour driven development tool in Ruby.
----

## Objective

A series of exercises to help me learn how to write tests with RSpec by:

[x] Testing Methods with Equality `eq`

[x] Testing Classes with Equality `eq`

[x] Testing for Errors with `raise_error`

> Keywords `raise_error` and `eq` are both kinds of 'matchers'

----

## how to run it

run it inside the testing-bites directory with the following commands in the command line:

- to test all spec files:
```shell
$ rspec
```

- to test a specific spec file: (for example, to test greet.rb)
```shell
$ rspec spec/greet_spec.rb
```
