# testing-bites

## about

A series of exercises to help me learn how to write tests with RSpec.
RSpec testing for:

1. Methods with Equality
2. Classes with Equality
3. Errors with raise_error matcher


## how to run it

run it inside the testing-bites directory with the following commands in the command line:

- to test all spec files:
```shell
$ rspec
```

- to test a specific spec file: (for example, to test greet.rb)
```shell
$ rspec spec/greet_spec.rb
```
